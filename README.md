# Route planner - A* Search
## Goal of the project 
The following project is an implementation of A* search algorithm to find closest path between 2 localizations on the map (OpenStreetMap). Demo below.
## A* Algorithm - theory
A* is a modification of Dijkstra’s Algorithm that is optimized for a single destination. Dijkstra’s Algorithm can find paths to all locations; A* finds paths to one location, or the closest of several locations. It prioritizes paths that seem to be leading closer to a goal.

## Stack used
C++ / OpenStreetMap data (Go to the following link -> https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/51.330/10.453 -> choose your region -> export -> XML file containing info about nodes will be generated)
